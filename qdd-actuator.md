# 🚀 Projects

Here is a collection of robotics projects I have worked on.

---

### 1. [Development of High-Performance Cycloidal QDD Actuator](/quasi-direct-drive-actuator/)
**📅 2024.01 - Present**

> **"Designed a low-cost, high-torque actuator for dynamic legged robots."**

I developed a custom Quasi-Direct Drive (QDD) actuator from scratch to overcome the limitations of expensive commercial motors. I designed a cycloidal reducer with a unique rolling contact mechanism to ensure back-drivability and impact resistance.

* **Key Features:**
    * Custom **Cycloidal Reducer** Design (15:1 Ratio)
    * **FOC Control** using Moteus controller
    * **3D Printed** Prototype & **CNC Machined** Final Version
* **Tech Stack:** Onshape (CAD), C++, BLDC Motor Winding, FEA Analysis
